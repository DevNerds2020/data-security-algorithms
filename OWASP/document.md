## A01: 2021 - Broken Access Control

- Moves up from the fifth position.
- 94% of applications were tested for some form of broken access control.
- The 34 Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) mapped to Broken Access Control had more occurrences in applications than any other category.

## A02: 2021 - Cryptographic Failures

- Shifts up one position to #2.
- Previously known as Sensitive Data Exposure, now focusing on failures related to cryptography.
- Often leads to sensitive data exposure or system compromise.

## A03: 2021 - Injection

- Slides down to the third position.
- 94% of applications were tested for some form of injection.
- The 33 CWEs mapped into this category have the second most occurrences in applications.
- Cross-site Scripting is now part of this category in this edition.

## A04: 2021 - Insecure Design

- A new category for 2021, with a focus on risks related to design flaws.
- Emphasizes the need for threat modeling, secure design patterns and principles, and reference architectures.

## A05: 2021 - Security Misconfiguration

- Moves up from #6 in the previous edition.
- 90% of applications were tested for some form of misconfiguration.
- Formerly included XML External Entities (XXE), now part of this category.

## A06: 2021 - Vulnerable and Outdated Components

- Previously titled Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities.
- #2 in the Top 10 community survey.
- Moves up from #9 in 2017.
- Known issue that is challenging to test and assess risk.
- The only category without any Common Vulnerability and Exposures (CVEs) mapped to the included CWEs.

## A07: 2021 - Identification and Authentication Failures

- Previously Broken Authentication.
- Slides down from the second position.
- Now includes CWEs that are more related to identification failures.
- Still an integral part of the Top 10.

## A08: 2021 - Software and Data Integrity Failures

- A new category for 2021.
- Focuses on making assumptions related to software updates, critical data, and CI/CD pipelines without verifying integrity.
- One of the highest weighted impacts from Common Vulnerability and Exposures/Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVE/CVSS) data.
- Insecure Deserialization from 2017 is now part of this larger category.

## A09: 2021 - Security Logging and Monitoring Failures

- Previously Insufficient Logging & Monitoring.
- Added from the industry survey (#3).
- Moves up from #10 previously.
- Expanded to include more types of failures.
- Challenging to test for and not well represented in the CVE/CVSS data.
- Failures in this category can directly impact visibility, incident alerting, and forensics.

## A10: 2021 - Server-Side Request Forgery

- Added from the Top 10 community survey (#1).
- Relatively low incidence rate with above-average testing coverage.
- Above-average ratings for Exploit and Impact potential.
- Represents a scenario where the security community members emphasize its importance, even though it's not illustrated in the data at this time.
