# What is RSA
RSA is an asymmetric encryption algorithm that uses a public key and a private key to encrypt and decrypt messages. It’s one of the most secure encryption methods after AES, and it’s used in most modern applications including web browsers and secure email services.

## Symmetric Vs Asymmetric Encryption
AES is a <b> symmetric-key algorithm </b>, meaning the same key (aka passphrase or password) is used to encrypt and decrypt the data. This characteristic presents pros and cons detailed in the following sections.

Asymmetric methods use a public key for encryption and a secret key for decryption. Anyone can send encrypted messages but only the receiver knows how to decrypt them. TLS certificates used for secure HTTP communication (HTTPS) leverage asymmetric encryption, for example.
